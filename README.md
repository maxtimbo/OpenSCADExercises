# OpenSCADExercises

I found these images on [r/FreeCAD](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeCAD/comments/rd6qc3/im_finished_with_the_part_exercises_from/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). I decided to try them in [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) to develop my skill base. 

I found the experience very rewarding as it helped me delve deeper into the docs and hash out some features of the software I was a little apprehensive to explore. 

If you're struggling with OpenSCAD, grab the ref image only and ploy into. Don't look at my code until you're completely done with all 24 exercises.

Everything here is kind of stream of mind. I did every exercise in order, so if you inspect the code, you can see how my usage of tools expanded and developed.
